Frog2 installation from source: README.install
Frog2 source code tree: README.directories
Forg2 sample tests: see the tests directory

MISSING: 
Full documentation about various options (contributions welcome)

=========================================================================
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: 

- include ring flexibility in conformer generation
- enhanced energy implementation (Frog2's is basically Torsion and Van der Waals)
